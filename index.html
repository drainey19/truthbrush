        <h2>Our Project</h2>
        <p>We are creating an adjustable, interchangeable toothbrush aimed towards homeless people and those in need of softer bristles. We are developing this product as our project for public health, as the health of someone's teeth impacts the health of the rest of their body. Many people don't have access to a new toothbrush every six months, and many people don't like brushing their teeth as it causes pain and discomfort.</p>

        <h2>Mission Statment</h2>
        <p>With our product we are aiming to provide an easier way for people to brush their teeth and have consistent access to a toothbrush. Not only will this be easy and accessible to all people, but the bristles will be adjustable that way people can adjust their toothbrush to be the most comfortable for them. With an easy and comfortable way to brush teeth we are hoping to make tooth brushing easier. The bristles will also be replaceable so that the user won't have to replace an entire toothbrush when the bristles become weak/worn down.</p>

        <h2>Our Goal</h2>
        <p>The goal of this project is to create a toothbrush that can be affordable and easy to service via interchangeable bristles. By changing the bristles, the optimal profile, and stiffness can be obtained for each user as well as making the base be usable for many years. This toothbrush can be geared for everyone, whether they have teeth or not. As toothbrushes should be changed out every few months, the idea of having a roll of bristle material allows for a low cost over the life of the product. The body will be silicone molded over a metal form to add weight and rigidity and the bristles will be a roll of extruded core with bristles distributed over the length of it that can be cut to length. The bristles can be found in different stiffnesses and can be shortened to preferences.</p>
